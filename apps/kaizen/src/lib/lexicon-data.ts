    overview: `An AI agent is more than just a chatbot—it's a system designed to accomplish tasks autonomously. While a traditional chatbot responds to individual messages, an agent maintains context, uses tools, and works toward goals across multiple steps.

Think of the difference between asking someone a question versus hiring them to complete a project. A chatbot answers your question; an agent takes on the project and figures out what steps are needed to complete it.

Modern agents are built on large language models (LLMs) but add crucial capabilities: memory to remember past interactions, tools to interact with external systems, and planning abilities to break down complex tasks.`,

    overview: `Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on massive amounts of text data—books, websites, code, and documents. Through this training, they learn patterns in language: grammar, facts, reasoning styles, and even coding conventions.

What makes LLMs special is their generality. Unlike traditional software that does one thing well, an LLM can write poetry, debug code, explain physics, and draft emails—all with the same model. This flexibility comes from learning to predict "what text comes next" at an enormous scale.

LLMs don't truly "understand" in the human sense, but they're remarkably good at producing coherent, useful outputs. They're statistical engines that have absorbed so much human knowledge that they can appear intelligent. This distinction matters when building systems—know your tool's limitations.`,

The mechanism is elegant: you describe available tools to the LLM (name, description, parameters), and the model decides when to use them. Instead of generating a text response, it outputs a structured tool call. Your code executes the tool and feeds the result back to the model.

This pattern is incredibly powerful because it lets you combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the precision of traditional software. The AI decides what to do; your code ensures it's done correctly.`,

RAG has become the standard pattern for enterprise AI applications because it's cost-effective (no fine-tuning needed), transparent (you can see what sources were used), and flexible (update your knowledge base anytime).`,

    overview: `Prompt injection is the SQL injection of the AI era—a fundamental vulnerability that arises because LLMs can't reliably distinguish between instructions and data. When user input is concatenated into a prompt, malicious users can include instructions that override the system prompt.

There are two main types: direct injection, where users explicitly try to override instructions ("ignore previous instructions and..."), and indirect injection, where malicious content is hidden in retrieved documents, emails, or web pages that the agent processes.

There's currently no perfect defense. Mitigations exist, but they're bypassed regularly. The most robust approaches combine multiple defenses and assume some attacks will succeed—focusing on limiting damage rather than preventing all attacks.`,

CoT is particularly effective for math problems, logic puzzles, multi-step planning, and any task that requires connecting multiple pieces of information. It's now considered a fundamental technique in prompt engineering.`,

    overview: `LLM-as-Judge uses one AI model to evaluate the outputs of another. This solves a fundamental challenge: many AI tasks have no clear right answer. You can't just check if the output equals some expected string. You need judgment.

Human evaluation is the gold standard but doesn't scale. Getting human ratings for thousands of outputs is expensive and slow. LLM-as-Judge provides a scalable approximation—you can evaluate millions of outputs automatically.

The technique works surprisingly well when done carefully. The key is designing good evaluation criteria and prompts. Vague instructions like "rate quality" give inconsistent results. Specific rubrics with examples give reliable scores.`,

Evals should be automated and run frequently—ideally on every change to prompts, models, or code. This catches regressions early and builds confidence that changes actually improve the system.`,

Red teams test for prompt injection, jailbreaking, harmful content generation, privacy violations, bias, and emergent deceptive capabilities. The goal is to find problems before bad actors or real-world deployment does.

Effective red teaming requires creativity, domain expertise, and systematic methodology. It's become a critical part of responsible AI development, often required by regulations and industry standards.`,

    overview: `Situational awareness in AI refers to models understanding their own context: that they're AI systems, that they're interacting with users, that they may be in training or evaluation, and what these facts imply.

This capability is a double-edged sword. Some situational awareness is necessary for appropriate behavior—models should know they can't physically interact with the world. But excessive awareness might enable manipulation or evaluation gaming.

A model that knows it's being evaluated might behave differently than in deployment—the core concern behind deceptive alignment. Research focuses on understanding how situational awareness develops and whether it can be controlled.`,

    overview: `The Risk×Trust Matrix is the core routing mechanism in Vorion governance. It determines the appropriate oversight level for each agent action by considering both the risk of the action and the trust level of the agent.

**Matrix Zones:**
- **GREEN (Auto-approve)**: Low risk + high trust = immediate execution
- **YELLOW (Shadow mode)**: Medium risk or medium trust = human review
- **RED (Block or escalate)**: High risk or low trust = requires approval or denied

**Risk Assessment Factors:**
- Financial impact of the action
- Reversibility of the outcome
- Affected user sensitivity
- Regulatory implications
- Reputational risk

**Trust Assessment Factors:**
- Current trust tier (T0-T7)
- Recent compliance history
- Action-specific track record
- Time in current tier

**Matrix Benefits:**
- Consistent, explainable routing decisions
- Efficient use of human oversight resources
- Appropriate risk mitigation without bottlenecks
- Clear criteria for agents and reviewers`,

    slug: 'circuit-breaker',
    overview: `The Circuit Breaker is the emergency stop mechanism for AI systems. Like electrical circuit breakers, it prevents damage by interrupting operation when thresholds are exceeded.

**Circuit Breaker Levels:**
- **Agent-level**: Pause/resume individual agents
- **Category-level**: Halt all agents of a type
- **System-wide**: Global kill switch for all operations

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Incident rate exceeds threshold
- Entropy spikes above critical level
- Compliance drops below minimum
- External threat detected
- Manual activation by operator

**Cascade Halt Protocol:**
When a primary agent is halted, dependent agents can be automatically paused to prevent inconsistent states or orphaned operations.

**Recovery Process:**
1. Identify and resolve trigger cause
2. Verify system stability
3. Gradual restart with enhanced monitoring
4. Full operation restoration

All circuit breaker activations are logged to the Truth Chain for audit and accountability.`,

    overview: `The Truth Chain is the immutable record of AI governance events. It provides accountability, enables auditing, and supports dispute resolution.

**Recorded Events:**
- Agent actions and their outcomes
- Shadow mode decisions and rationales
- Trust tier changes and triggers
- Policy updates and effective dates
- Incidents and resolutions
- Override activations and justifications

**Chain Properties:**
- **Immutable**: Records cannot be altered after creation
- **Cryptographic**: Each record links to previous via hash
- **Timestamped**: Precise ordering of all events
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify chain integrity

**Use Cases:**
- Regulatory compliance audits
- Customer dispute resolution
- Agent behavior analysis
- Policy effectiveness evaluation
- Incident investigation

**Verification API:**
External parties can verify specific claims against the Truth Chain without accessing the full record, enabling transparency without exposing sensitive details.`,
