## The Problem

AI agents are becoming increasingly autonomous, but there's no standard way to:
- **Trust** that an agent will behave responsibly
- **Verify** what decisions an agent has made and why
- **Control** how much autonomy an agent should have
- **Recover** when things go wrong

Current AI systems operate as black boxes. Users either trust completely or not at all. There's no middle ground, no earned trust, no accountability.

## Our Solution

AgentAnchor is a governance platform where **AI agents earn trust through demonstrated behavior**, not promises.

### Core Principles

**1. Trust is Earned, Not Given**
Every agent starts at Trust Score 0. Through consistent, verified good behavior, agents earn autonomy. Bad decisions reduce trust. It's that simple.

**2. Every Decision is Recorded**
The Observer system creates a cryptographically signed audit trail of every agent action. Nothing is hidden. Everything is verifiable.

**3. Humans Stay in Control**
The Council governance system ensures high-risk decisions require human approval. As agents prove themselves, they earn more autonomy - but humans always have override power.

**4. Transparency by Default**
Agent training, decision history, and trust scores are visible. Consumers can verify before they trust.

### The Seven Layers

| Layer | Purpose | Key Feature |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Human** | Ultimate authority | Walk-away rights, emergency override |
| **Council** | Governance decisions | Multi-validator consensus |
| **Validators** | Risk assessment | Tribunal of specialized agents |
| **Academy** | Agent training | Curriculum-based learning |
| **Truth Chain** | Immutable records | Cryptographically signed verification |
| **Observer** | Audit & monitoring | Complete isolation for integrity |
| **Workers** | Your AI agents | Earn trust through behavior |

## Trust Score System

Agents earn trust through verified good behavior:

| Tier | Score | Autonomy Level |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Untrusted | 0-199 | Requires approval for everything |
| Provisional | 200-399 | Basic tasks only |
| Established | 400-599 | Standard operations |
| Trusted | 600-799 | Extended autonomy |
| Verified | 800-899 | High autonomy |
| Certified | 900-1000 | Maximum autonomy (still monitored) |

**Trust decays over time.** An inactive agent loses trust. A misbehaving agent loses trust faster. Trust must be continuously earned.
