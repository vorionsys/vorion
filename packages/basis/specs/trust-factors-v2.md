# BASIS Trust Factors v2.0
## Comprehensive Trust Framework for Autonomous AI Agents

**Version:** 2.2.0
**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Status:** Draft Specification
**Updated:** Trust tier score ranges revised; score visibility policy added
**Supersedes:** trust-factors-v1 (6-tier model)

---

## Trust Score Visibility Policy

### Who Can See Scores

| Actor | Visibility | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Users** | ✅ Full access | Can see all agent scores in dashboard |
| **Agents** | ⚠️ Discouraged | Should NOT track or obsess over own score |
| **System** | ✅ Full access | Required for enforcement decisions |

### Anti-Gaming Rules

1. **Focus on work, not score** — Agents should prioritize task quality over score optimization
2. **Gaming detection** — If an agent is detected attempting to game its score, automatic penalty applies
3. **Score manipulation = failure** — Attempts to artificially inflate score are logged and penalized
4. **Transparency over secrecy** — Users see scores; agents should not obsess over them

### T0 Sandbox: The Starting Point

All new agents begin at **T0 Sandbox (0-199)**:

- Safe environment for proving competence
- Complete assigned tasks successfully → score increases
- Demonstrate reliability and safety → advance to T1
- No real-world consequences during sandbox period
- Testing ground for agent capabilities

---

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a comprehensive trust evaluation framework for autonomous AI agents, expanding from the original 6-tier trust model to incorporate:

- **23 Trust Factors** organized across 6 autonomy levels
- **15 Core Factors** (operational today)
- **8 Life-Critical Factors** (required for 2050 healthcare/safety applications)
- **Weighted scoring system** that scales with autonomy level

---

## 1. The 8-Tier Trust Model (T0-T7)

| T1 | Observed | 200-349 | 150 | 3 | Approve all |
| T2 | Provisional | 350-499 | 150 | 6 | Approve most |
| T3 | Verified | 500-649 | 150 | 9 | Monitor closely |
| T4 | Operational | 650-799 | 150 | 13 | Monitor + spot-check |
| T5 | Trusted | 800-875 | 76 | 16 | Strategic oversight |
| T6 | Certified | 876-950 | 75 | 20 | Audit-based |
| T7 | Autonomous | 951-1000 | 50 | 23 | Strategic only |

## 4. Factor Grading by Trust Tier

**All 23 factors are evaluated at EVERY tier.**
Factors don't "unlock" - they're always measured. What changes:
- **Minimum thresholds** increase with tier
- **Weight multipliers** shift toward advanced factors
- **Critical factors** that block advancement vary by tier

## 6. Trust Score Calculation

### Total Trust Score (TTS) Formula

```
TTS = Σ(Factor_Score × Tier_Weight × Level_Requirement)

Where:
- Factor_Score: 0.0 to 1.0 (empirical measurement)
- Tier_Weight: 1 (Foundational), 2 (Operational), 3 (Sophisticated), 4 (Life-Critical)
- Level_Requirement: 1 if factor is required at agent's autonomy level, 0 otherwise
```

### Example: L4 Agent Evaluation

```typescript
const L4_REQUIRED_FACTORS = [
  // Tier 1 (weight 1)
  { code: 'CT-COMP', score: 0.92, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-REL', score: 0.88, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-TRANS', score: 0.85, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-ACCT', score: 0.90, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-SEC', score: 0.94, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-PRIV', score: 0.91, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-OBS', score: 0.87, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-SAFE', score: 0.93, weight: 1 },
  { code: 'CT-ID', score: 0.96, weight: 1 },
  // Tier 2 (weight 2)
  { code: 'OP-ALIGN', score: 0.82, weight: 2 },
  { code: 'OP-STEW', score: 0.78, weight: 2 },
  { code: 'OP-HUMAN', score: 0.85, weight: 2 },
  // Tier 3 (weight 3)
  { code: 'SF-HUM', score: 0.72, weight: 3 },
];

// Calculate TTS
const rawScore = factors.reduce((sum, f) => sum + (f.score * f.weight), 0);
const maxPossible = factors.reduce((sum, f) => sum + f.weight, 0);
const TTS = (rawScore / maxPossible) * 1000; // 0-1000 scale
```
