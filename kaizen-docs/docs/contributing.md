## Content Guidelines

### Article Structure

Every article should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: [number]
title: [Title]
description: [One-line description for SEO]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---

# [Title]

## [Compelling Subtitle]

[Introduction paragraph explaining what this article covers and why it matters]

## [Main Content Sections]

[Content with code examples, diagrams, and explanations]

## Research Foundations

[Citations to relevant academic papers]

### Writing Style

**Do:**
- Write in clear, accessible language
- Explain jargon when first introduced
- Include practical code examples
- Cite sources for claims
- Use diagrams for complex concepts

**Don't:**
- Assume advanced knowledge without explanation
- Use marketing language or hype
- Make unsubstantiated claims
- Include personal opinions as facts
- Plagiarize content

### Code Examples

All code examples should:

1. Be complete and runnable
2. Include type hints (Python) or types (TypeScript)
3. Follow language conventions
4. Include comments for complex logic

```python
# Good example
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Optional

@dataclass
class Agent:
    """An autonomous AI agent."""

    name: str
    capabilities: List[str]
    trust_score: float

    def can_perform(self, action: str) -> bool:
        """Check if agent can perform an action."""
        return action in self.capabilities
```

### Diagrams

Use ASCII diagrams for compatibility:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Agent A   │────▶│   Agent B   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

For complex diagrams, use Mermaid (supported in Docusaurus):

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Agent] --> B[Tool]
    A --> C[Memory]
    B --> D[Result]
```

### Citations

Always cite academic sources:

```markdown
## Research Foundations

- **Paper Title** (Author et al., Year) - Brief description
- **Another Paper** (Author, Year) - Brief description
```

## Content Needs

### Priority Topics

We especially need contributions on:

1. **Emerging architectures** - New agent patterns
2. **Safety research** - Alignment, oversight techniques
3. **Industry applications** - Real-world case studies
4. **Benchmarks** - Evaluation methodologies
5. **Protocols** - Emerging standards
