# ORION External Acceptance Conflict Detection (EASE)

**STATUS:** CANONICAL / NO-DRIFT
**ROLE:** Release-blocking gate for external acceptance readiness

---

## Overview

EASE (External Acceptance Simulation Engine) ensures ORION is always ready for external scrutiny. It simulates the perspectives of:

- Auditors (SOC 2, ISO, NIST)
- Procurement teams (government, enterprise)
- Regulators (FedRAMP, GDPR, EU AI Act)
- Vendor risk assessors
- CTO/CISO panels

**Missing acceptance artifacts = SYSTEM CONFLICT = Release blocked**

---

## Core Principle

ORION must always be able to answer:

> "Can you prove you're doing what you claim, in a way that satisfies [auditor/regulator/procurement]?"

If the answer is "not yet" or "partially," that's a **system conflict**.

- Vendor/subprocessor list

### 2. Enterprise Assurance Packs

**Audience:** SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / NIST auditors

**Contents:**
- Control mapping documents
- Evidence collection procedures
- Change management records
- Access review reports
- Incident logs
- Risk assessments
- Penetration test summaries

### 3. Vendor/Partner Packs

**Audience:** Third-party integrators, partners, resellers

**Contents:**
- RCAR matrix
- Liability boundaries
- Integration requirements
- Certification path
- SLA definitions
- Escalation procedures
- Data flow diagrams

### 4. Developer Compliance Packs

**Audience:** SDK users, contributors, integrators

**Contents:**
- SDK conformance certification
- Redacted debug traces
- Audit dry-run results
- Contract compliance verification
- Integration test results
- Security best practices guide

## Conflict Detection

EASE scans for conflicts by simulating external perspectives:

### Auditor Simulation

- Are all required controls documented?
- Is evidence collection automated?
- Are change records complete?
- Can we prove continuous compliance?

### Procurement Simulation

- Is documentation procurement-ready?
- Are security questionnaires answerable?
- Is pricing/licensing clear?
- Are support SLAs defined?

### Regulator Simulation

- Is data handling documented?
- Are retention policies enforced?
- Is consent management in place?
- Are audit exports available?

### Vendor Risk Simulation

- Is the security posture documented?
- Are third-party dependencies listed?
- Is incident response tested?
- Is business continuity planned?

## Conflict Types

| Severity | Description | Release Impact |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| CRITICAL | Missing required artifact | **BLOCKED** |
| HIGH | Incomplete artifact | **BLOCKED** |
| MEDIUM | Outdated artifact | Warning, review required |
| LOW | Enhancement opportunity | Noted |

## Release Gate Integration

EASE is a **non-negotiable release gate**:

1. Every PR runs EASE scan
2. Protected branches require EASE pass
3. Release candidates must generate all packets
4. Conflicts block merge until resolved

---

## Continuous Improvement

EASE learns from:

- Actual audit findings
- Procurement feedback
- Regulatory updates
- Industry standard changes

Updates to EASE detection rules require joint approval.

---

## Testing Requirements

EASE changes require:

- [ ] Conflict detection tests
- [ ] Packet generation tests
- [ ] False positive/negative analysis
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Integration with CI pipeline
