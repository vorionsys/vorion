PROBLEM

Organizations deploying autonomous AI systems face a critical governance gap. Current approaches lack:

1. Precise behavioral constraints defining operational boundaries
2. Dynamic trust mechanisms that adjust permissions based on demonstrated behavior
3. Immutable audit trails that satisfy regulatory requirements
4. Real-time enforcement preventing unauthorized actions before they occur

This gap creates material risks across sectors. Financial AI might exceed risk parameters without detection. Healthcare AI might recommend treatments outside approved protocols. Critical infrastructure AI might take irreversible actions. The EU AI Act (effective August 2026) mandates governance for high-risk AI systems, yet practical implementation tools remain underdeveloped.

Research from the AI Energy Score project (Hugging Face/Salesforce) shows reasoning-enabled models consume 30x more energy than standard inference on average, with individual models ranging from 2x to over 6,000x. Without governance, inefficient AI agents become vectors for resource exhaustion attacks and economic denial-of-service conditions. Microsoft's 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report documented a 29% increase in emissions from 2020-2023, driven significantly by AI infrastructure. Sustainability governance is increasingly material.

APPROACH

Vorion implements Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA)—a hazard analysis methodology from MIT used in aviation and nuclear safety—as the architectural foundation for AI governance. This provides:

1. CONSTRAINT ENFORCEMENT: Policies expressed as machine-readable rules evaluated at sub-millisecond speed. Constraints define what AI agents can and cannot do, with governance decisions of ALLOW, DENY, ESCALATE (require human approval), or DEGRADE (reduced scope).

2. QUANTIFIED TRUST SCORING: Behavioral trust scores (0-1000 scale) calculated from historical actions, compliance record, and contextual signals. Scores map to capability tiers:
   - Sandbox [0-100): Isolated testing only
   - Provisional [100-300): Read public data, internal messaging
   - Standard [300-500): Limited external communication
   - Trusted [500-700): External API calls
   - Certified [700-900): Financial transactions
   - Autonomous [900-1000]: Full autonomy within policy bounds

3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUDITABILITY: SHA-256 hash chains with Ed25519 signatures create immutable records of every governance decision. This enables forensic analysis, regulatory demonstration, and tamper detection.

4. EFFICIENCY GOVERNANCE: Cost-to-value (CTV) monitoring with defined response thresholds prevents resource exhaustion:
   - [0, 1.0): Excellent—continue
   - [1.0, 2.0): Acceptable—monitor
   - [2.0, 5.0): Marginal—alert, suggest optimization
   - [5.0, 10.0): Poor—throttle capacity
   - [10.0, 20.0): Unacceptable—degrade to minimal operations
   - [20.0, +inf): Critical—stop, require human review

RELEVANCE TO AI GOVERNANCE

Vorion addresses priorities for technical AI governance:

Standards Implementation: We provide practical implementations of governance standards that can serve as reference architectures. Our constraint specification language and trust scoring methodology could inform tooling standards as frameworks mature.

Model Evaluation Infrastructure: The cryptographic proof system creates verifiable behavioral records enabling continuous evaluation of deployed AI. The Trust Engine provides real-time behavioral assessment across agent populations.

Regulatory Compliance: Designed for EU AI Act, ISO 42001, and NIST AI RMF compliance. As these frameworks become mandatory, organizations need infrastructure to demonstrate compliance. Our compliance mapping shows alignment points with each framework.

GLOBAL CATASTROPHIC RISK CONSIDERATIONS

While Vorion targets near-term enterprise governance, the architectural patterns address foundational challenges relevant to advanced AI:

- Constraint enforcement ensuring AI operates within defined boundaries scales with system capability
- Graduated trust based on demonstrated behavior provides a framework for appropriately limiting autonomy
- Immutable audit trails enable verification of AI behavior—essential for any accountability framework
- Fail-safe defaults (STPA pattern) ensure unknown situations trigger restrictive responses

Governance infrastructure developed for today's AI systems informs approaches to more capable future systems.

FUNDING REQUEST

We are seeking $750,000 over 18 months to:

1. Complete core platform development (BASIS constraint engine, Trust Engine, Proof system)
2. Open-source governance primitives under Apache-2.0 license
3. Pilot with 3-5 enterprise partners in regulated industries (finance, healthcare)
4. Publish governance methodology and empirical findings
5. Engage with standards bodies (NIST, ISO) on practical implementation guidance

Key milestones include:
- Month 6: Core specification finalized, reference implementation available
- Month 12: Enterprise pilot deployments, initial empirical data
- Month 18: Standards engagement, governance tooling documentation

TEAM

Vorion is a US-based organization focused on AI governance infrastructure. The founding team combines experience in:

```

### 10. Anything else you'd like us to know?
```
Vorion is purpose-built for AI governance—it's the core mission, not a pivot or side project. We're committed to open-sourcing governance primitives while building sustainable enterprise tooling.

Technical resources available for review:
- BASIS specification: https://basis.vorion.org
- Core specification: https://basis.vorion.org/spec/overview
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/voriongit/vorion

We believe practical infrastructure developed now will shape how AI systems are governed as capabilities scale. We're particularly interested in dialogue about how enterprise governance tools can contribute to broader AI safety goals, and how lessons from deploying governance in regulated industries might inform approaches to frontier AI governance.

We recently submitted comments to NIST on the Cybersecurity Framework Profile for Artificial Intelligence (NIST IR 8596), proposing integration of efficiency governance and trust-based autonomy frameworks. This reflects our engagement with emerging standards.

Happy to provide technical demonstrations, architecture deep-dives, or connect you with enterprise prospects who can speak to governance challenges they face.

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS TO EMPHASIZE

If there's room for follow-up conversation, emphasize:

1. **Control Theory Foundation**: Built on STPA (MIT's hazard analysis), not retrofitted security
2. **Quantified Trust**: Only governance approach with graduated permissions based on behavioral scoring
3. **Cryptographic Proof**: Blockchain-like integrity without blockchain overhead
4. **Efficiency Focus**: CTV monitoring addresses sustainability as governance concern
5. **Open Standards**: Apache-2.0 licensing for governance primitives
6. **Regulatory Alignment**: EU AI Act, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF from design

## COMPARISON TO OTHER APPROACHES

If asked how Vorion differs from alternatives:

| Alternative | Gap Vorion Fills |
|-------------|------------------|
| Logging tools (Splunk, etc.) | Record after the fact, no enforcement or trust |
| Policy engines (OPA) | Generic policies, no AI-specific constraints or trust |
| AI monitoring (Arize, WhyLabs) | ML model metrics, not behavioral governance |
| Compliance tools | Document-focused, not real-time enforcement |

Vorion provides **proactive enforcement** (prevent, not detect), **behavioral trust** (graduated permissions), and **cryptographic proof** (immutable audit).
