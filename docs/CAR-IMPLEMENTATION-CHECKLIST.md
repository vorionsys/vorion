## 🔧 Phase 3 Gap-Fill Implementation (Weeks 7-10)

### Priority 1: Critical Security Gaps

#### 1. Skill Bitmask Implementation
- [ ] Design skill encoding scheme
- [ ] Implement parser for skill domains
- [ ] Add to TypeScript package
- [ ] Examples: language skills, domain expertise, tool mastery
- [ ] Timeline: Week 7

**What**: Agents declare micro-capabilities (e.g., "Python", "REST APIs", "SQL")  
**Why**: Better capability matching than broad domains  
**Example**: `a3i.vorion.code-reviewer:IS-L3-T2-SK[python,rst,sql]@1.2.0`

#### 2. Runtime Drift Detection
- [ ] Define drift metrics (capability deviation, behavior change)
- [ ] Implement monitoring in Vorion PROOF module
- [ ] Alert on threshold crossing
- [ ] Create remediation workflow
- [ ] Timeline: Week 8

**What**: Detect when agent behavior diverges from baseline  
**Why**: Prevent subtle trust degradation  
**Mechanism**: Compare current behavior to historical patterns

#### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- [ ] Implement in COGNIGATE execution layer
- [ ] Detect recursive loops (same action 3+ times without state change)
- [ ] Automatic pause + human review
- [ ] Resource limit enforcement ($, API calls, time)
- [ ] Timeline: Week 8-9

**What**: Stop agents from spinning in error loops  
**Why**: Prevent cost overruns, protect infrastructure  
**Trigger**: Same semantic action × 3 without progress → HALT

#### 4. Quantum-Safe Migration Path
- [ ] Research post-quantum algorithms (ML-DSA/Dilithium preferred)
- [ ] Design hybrid mode (ES256 + PQC)
- [ ] No breaking changes during transition
- [ ] Publish timeline: 2026 migration, 2027 full adoption
- [ ] Timeline: Week 9-10

**What**: Prepare for cryptographically-relevant quantum computers  
**Why**: Protect long-term agent trustworthiness  
**Approach**: Hybrid signatures now, PQC-only by 2027

### Priority 2: Production Hardening

#### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite
- [ ] Unit tests: Parser, validators, registry client (95%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests: Registry API, DPoP validation, TEE attestation
- [ ] Property-based tests: Fuzzing, chaos engineering
- [ ] Compliance tests: EU AI Act, ISO 42001 mappings
- [ ] Performance tests: Registry queries (< 100ms), parsing (< 1ms)
- [ ] Timeline: Week 7-9

#### 6. Security Audit Preparation
- [ ] Document security model (threat model, assumptions)
- [ ] Red-teaming report (internal, ready for external audit)
- [ ] Penetration testing plan
- [ ] Incident response procedure
- [ ] SLA for security patches
- [ ] Timeline: Week 9-10

#### 7. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Load test registry API (10K agents, 1K QPS)
- [ ] Cache strategy (Redis, CDN)
- [ ] Database optimization (query plans, indexing)
- [ ] Geographic distribution (federation strategy)
- [ ] Timeline: Week 9
