# Contributing to BASIS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the BASIS standard. This document outlines how to participate in the development of the specification and reference implementations.

## The Role of VORION

**VORION** serves as the commercial steward of BASIS, maintaining the specification and ensuring it remains:

- **Open**: Free to use, implement, and extend
- **Stable**: Changes follow a rigorous RFC process
- **Interoperable**: Implementations must pass conformance tests

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

Found a bug in the schema? Unclear specification language? [Open an issue](https://github.com/voriongit/basis-core/issues) with:

- Clear description of the problem
- Relevant section of the spec or schema
- Suggested improvement (if any)

### 2. Proposing Changes (CRC Process)

Significant changes to BASIS follow the **Community Request for Comments (CRC)** process:

1. **Draft**: Create a proposal in `proposals/crc-NNNN-title.md`
2. **Discussion**: Open a PR and gather community feedback (minimum 14 days)
3. **Revision**: Address feedback and refine the proposal
4. **Vote**: Steering committee votes on adoption
5. **Implementation**: Accepted CRCs are implemented in the next minor/major version

#### CRC Template

```markdown
# CRC-NNNN: Title

**Author:** Your Name

### 3. Reference Implementations

We welcome implementations in new languages. Requirements:

- Must pass the conformance test suite
- Must include comprehensive documentation
- Must be licensed under Apache 2.0 or compatible

### 4. Example Policies

Share real-world policy bundles (sanitized) to help others:

- Place in `examples/` directory
- Include descriptive comments
- Ensure no proprietary or sensitive information

## Development Setup
