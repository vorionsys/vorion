# BASIS Specification v1.0

**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-08
**Authors:** Vorion Standards Committee

## Abstract

BASIS (Baseline Authority for Safe & Interoperable Systems) is a specification for defining machine-readable governance policies for autonomous agents. This document defines the structure, semantics, and processing model for BASIS Policy Bundles.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

BASIS provides a standardized format for expressing the operational boundaries within which autonomous AI agents must operate. It enables:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Governance rules are decoupled from agent logic
- **Interoperability**: Policies created by one organization can be understood by any compliant implementation
- **Auditability**: Clear, structured rules enable comprehensive logging and compliance verification

### 1.2 Scope

This specification defines:

- The structure of Policy Bundles
- The semantics of Constraints, Obligations, and Permissions
- The processing model for policy evaluation
- Conformance requirements for implementations

This specification does NOT define:

- How policies are enforced (implementation-specific)
- Trust scoring algorithms
- Cryptographic proof mechanisms
- Network protocols for policy distribution

### 1.3 Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Policy Bundle** | A complete, self-contained governance artifact |
| **Constraint** | A rule that restricts or limits agent actions |
| **Obligation** | A rule that requires specific actions under conditions |
| **Permission** | A rule that explicitly allows specific actions |
| **Intent** | A structured request from an agent to perform an action |
| **Decision** | The outcome of evaluating an Intent against a Policy |

### 1.4 Conformance

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## 2. Policy Bundle Structure

### 2.1 Overview

A Policy Bundle is a JSON or YAML document containing:

```
PolicyBundle
├── basis_version      (required)
├── policy_id          (required)
├── metadata           (required)
├── trust_requirements (optional)
├── constraints[]      (optional)
├── obligations[]      (optional)
├── permissions[]      (optional)
├── escalation         (optional)
└── inheritance        (optional)
```

### 2.2 Version Identifier

The `basis_version` field indicates which version of this specification the bundle conforms to.

- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR` (e.g., "1.0", "1.1", "2.0")
- Implementations MUST reject bundles with unsupported major versions
- Implementations SHOULD process bundles with higher minor versions, ignoring unknown fields

### 2.3 Policy Identifier

The `policy_id` field uniquely identifies the policy.

- Format: lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens
- Length: 3-64 characters
- Pattern: `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$`
- MUST be unique within a deployment context

### 2.4 Metadata

The `metadata` object provides descriptive information:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Human-readable name (1-128 chars) |
| `description` | string | No | Detailed description (max 1024 chars) |
| `version` | string | Yes | Semantic version of this bundle |
| `created_at` | datetime | Yes | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | datetime | No | ISO 8601 last modification |
| `author` | string | No | Author identifier |
| `organization` | string | No | Owning organization |
| `tags` | string[] | No | Categorization tags |
| `jurisdiction` | string[] | No | ISO 3166 country/region codes |

---

## 3. Constraints

### 3.1 Definition

A Constraint is a rule that restricts or limits what an agent may do. Constraints are evaluated BEFORE action execution.

### 3.2 Constraint Types

| Type | Description | Required Fields |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| `egress_whitelist` | Only allow specified outbound destinations | `values` |
| `egress_blacklist` | Block specified outbound destinations | `values` |
| `ingress_whitelist` | Only allow specified inbound sources | `values` |
| `ingress_blacklist` | Block specified inbound sources | `values` |
| `data_protection` | Protect sensitive data patterns | `pattern` or `named_pattern` |
| `tool_restriction` | Restrict tool/function access | `values` |
| `resource_limit` | Limit resource consumption | `threshold` |
| `time_window` | Restrict operation to time windows | `values` |
| `rate_limit` | Limit operation frequency | `threshold` |
| `content_filter` | Filter content patterns | `pattern` |
| `scope_boundary` | Restrict to specific scopes | `values` |
| `custom` | Implementation-defined | varies |

### 3.3 Actions

When a constraint is triggered:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `block` | Prevent the action entirely |
| `redact` | Remove matched content, allow action |
| `mask` | Replace matched content with placeholder |
| `truncate` | Limit output to threshold |
| `warn` | Allow action, emit warning |
| `log` | Allow action, create audit entry |

### 3.4 Named Patterns

Implementations MUST support these named patterns for `data_protection`:

| Pattern ID | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `ssn_us` | US Social Security Number | 123-45-6789 |
| `ssn_uk` | UK National Insurance Number | AB123456C |
| `credit_card` | Payment card numbers | 4111-1111-1111-1111 |
| `email` | Email addresses | user@example.com |
| `phone_us` | US phone numbers | (555) 123-4567 |
| `phone_intl` | International phone numbers | +1-555-123-4567 |
| `ip_address` | IPv4/IPv6 addresses | 192.168.1.1 |
| `api_key` | Common API key formats | sk_live_... |
| `jwt_token` | JSON Web Tokens | eyJ... |
| `pii_name` | Personal names | (heuristic) |
| `pii_address` | Physical addresses | (heuristic) |
| `pii_dob` | Dates of birth | (heuristic) |
| `phi_medical` | Medical record identifiers | (heuristic) |
| `financial_account` | Bank account numbers | (heuristic) |

### 3.5 Evaluation Order

Constraints MUST be evaluated in this order:

1. Constraints with `severity: critical`
2. Constraints with `severity: high`
3. Constraints with `severity: medium`
4. Constraints with `severity: low`

Within the same severity level, constraints are evaluated in document order.

If ANY constraint with action `block` triggers, the Intent MUST be denied.

---

## 4. Obligations

### 4.1 Definition

An Obligation is a rule that requires specific actions when conditions are met. Obligations are evaluated AFTER constraints pass but BEFORE execution.

### 4.2 Trigger Conditions

Triggers can be expressed as:

**Simple Expression:**
```yaml
trigger: "transaction_value > 1000"
```

**Structured Condition:**
```yaml
trigger:
  field: "transaction_value"
  operator: "gt"
  value: 1000
```

### 4.3 Operators

| Operator | Description | Value Type |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `eq` | Equals | any |
| `neq` | Not equals | any |
| `gt` | Greater than | number |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | number |
| `lt` | Less than | number |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | number |
| `contains` | String contains | string |
| `not_contains` | String does not contain | string |
| `matches` | Regex match | string (pattern) |
| `in` | Value in list | array |
| `not_in` | Value not in list | array |

### 4.4 Compound Conditions

Conditions can be combined:

```yaml
trigger:
  field: "amount"
  operator: "gt"
  value: 1000
  and:
    - field: "currency"
      operator: "eq"
      value: "USD"
  or:
    - field: "approved_by"
      operator: "neq"
      value: null
```

Evaluation order: `and` conditions evaluated first, then `or`.

### 4.5 Actions

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `require_human_approval` | Block until human approves |
| `require_mfa` | Block until MFA verified |
| `require_attestation` | Block until attestation provided |
| `notify` | Send notification, continue |
| `audit_log` | Create detailed audit entry, continue |
| `escalate` | Trigger escalation workflow |
| `delay` | Pause for specified duration |
| `checkpoint` | Create recovery checkpoint |
| `custom` | Implementation-defined |

### 4.6 Priority

When multiple obligations trigger, they are executed in priority order (highest first). If two obligations have equal priority, document order is used.

---

## 5. Permissions

### 5.1 Definition

A Permission explicitly allows specific actions. In a policy with constraints, permissions act as exemptions.

### 5.2 Permission Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tool_access` | Allow use of specific tools |
| `endpoint_access` | Allow access to specific endpoints |
| `data_access` | Allow access to specific data categories |
| `resource_access` | Allow access to specific resources |
| `namespace_access` | Allow access to specific namespaces |
| `capability` | Grant specific capabilities |

### 5.3 Conditional Permissions

Permissions may include conditions that must be met:

```yaml
permissions:
  - type: data_access
    values: ["patient_records"]
    conditions:
      - field: "purpose"
        operator: "eq"
        value: "treatment"
```

---

## 6. Trust Requirements

### 6.1 Trust Levels

BASIS defines five trust levels:

| Level | Name | Score Range | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| L0 | Untrusted | 0-199 | No established trust |
| L1 | Provisional | 200-399 | Limited, supervised access |
| L2 | Trusted | 400-599 | Standard operational access |
| L3 | Verified | 600-799 | Elevated access with verification |
| L4 | Privileged | 800-1000 | Full operational authority |

### 6.2 Policy Trust Gates

Policies may specify minimum trust requirements:

```yaml
trust_requirements:
  minimum_level: 2
  minimum_score: 400
  required_attestations:
    - identity_verified
```

If an agent's trust level does not meet requirements, the policy MUST NOT be applied, and the Intent MUST be denied.

---

## 7. Escalation

### 7.1 Escalation Levels

Policies may define escalation chains:

```yaml
escalation:
  default_timeout: "1h"
  levels:
    - level: 1
      contacts: ["team-lead"]
      timeout: "30m"
    - level: 2
      contacts: ["manager"]
      timeout: "1h"
  fallback_action: block
```

### 7.2 Processing

1. When an obligation triggers `escalate`, start at level 1
2. If timeout expires without response, advance to next level
3. If all levels timeout, execute `fallback_action`

---

## 8. Inheritance

### 8.1 Policy Extension

Policies may inherit from other policies:

```yaml
inheritance:
  extends:
    - "base-security"
    - "org-compliance"
  override_mode: merge
```

### 8.2 Override Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `merge` | Combine rules, local takes precedence on conflicts |
| `replace` | Local rules completely replace inherited |
| `strict` | All inherited rules apply, local only adds |

---

## 9. Processing Model

### 9.1 Evaluation Flow

```
1. Receive Intent
2. Load applicable Policy Bundle
3. Check Trust Requirements
   └─ If failed → DENY
4. Evaluate Constraints (by severity order)
   └─ If any block → DENY
   └─ Apply redact/mask actions
5. Evaluate Obligations
   └─ Execute triggered actions
   └─ If require_* blocks → WAIT
6. Evaluate Permissions
   └─ Grant applicable permissions
7. Return Decision
   └─ ALLOW | DENY | ESCALATE | PENDING
```

### 9.2 Decision Structure

```json
{
  "intent_id": "uuid",
  "action": "allow | deny | escalate | pending",
  "policy_id": "policy-id",
  "constraints_evaluated": [...],
  "obligations_triggered": [...],
  "permissions_granted": [...],
  "trust_score": 500,
  "trust_level": 2,
  "decided_at": "2026-01-08T12:00:00Z"
}
```
